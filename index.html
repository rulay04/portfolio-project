      <h3>RPE Calc</h3>
      <p class="info">
        In the pursuit of leveraging technology for fitness tracking, we embarked on a project focused on using a
        Micro:bit to calculate velocity during weightlifting exercises. The goal was to analyze this data, categorize
        the exertion level using a defined Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale, and calculate power output, as well
        as create a graph to reflect their trial results. The project involved creating a web interface using React,
        Node.js, and CSS to visualize and interpret the collected data.
      </p>

      <h3>Interview Chatbot</h3>

      <p class="info">
        With the goal of enhancing interview preparation through innovative technology, I developed an Interview
        Chatbot. The primary goal was to create an interactive platform that assists users in preparing for job
        interviews. The project involves leveraging the Flask framework for the backend, HTML for the user interface,
        and CSS for
        styling. The bot is able to ask several questions in list form, as well as help users improve their answers by
        providing advice, as well as coding problems and analyze the user's code, increasing in difficulty.

      <h2>üåÆ More Projects</h2>

      <h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>
      <p class="info">
        In the quest to enhance my understanding of web development, I undertook a project to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game.
        The primary objective was to gain insights into building interactive and dynamic user interfaces using React.
        The project involved using Node.js for the backend and React for the frontend, with HTML and CSS contributing to
        the overall structure and styling. It taught me a lot about component diagrams and their importance in building
        a seamless UI.
      </p>
      <h3>IGN Ratings Web Scraper</h3>
      <p class="info">
        In the pursuit of automating and enhancing data analysis, I embarked on a web scraping project utilizing Jupyter
        Notebook, Pandas, Beautiful Soup, and the Requests library. The primary objective was to extract information
        from online sources, specifically from a chart, and enrich the dataset with additional details fetched from
        external websites. This project provided valuable insights into networking, making requests, and parsing HTML
        content.
      </p>
      <h3>Fashion Facade</h3>
      <p class="info">
        ‚ÄúFashion Facade‚Äù was a transformative project initiated under Girls Who Code, showcasing a commitment to raising
        awareness about the environmental and ethical consequences of fast fashion. Developed using HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript on Replit, the website provided a platform to educate visitors about the hidden costs behind the
        glamour of the fashion industry. While it was one of my very first projects (around 2020), the issue has only
        gotten worse, which is why I still feel passionately about this cause.
